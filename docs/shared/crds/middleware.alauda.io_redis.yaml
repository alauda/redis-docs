                                            MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                            be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                            to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                            for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                            Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                              seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                              It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                              Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                              "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                              This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                              "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                              This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                              It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                              Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                              whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                              CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                              "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                              and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                              This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                              All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                                The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for

                                "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not

                                EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                than a virtual IP.
                                "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                as the clusterIP.
                                "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                          seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                          It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                          Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                          "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                          This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                          "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                          This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                          It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                          Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                          whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                          CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                          "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                          and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                          This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                          All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.
