# Upgrade

This document provides technical guidance for upgrading Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS, including version compatibility, upgrade paths, and operational procedures.

## Version Compatibility Principles

Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS follows semantic versioning with the following compatibility guarantees:

* **Patch versions** (x.y.**z**) within the same minor version are fully backward and forward compatible
* **Minor versions** (x.**y**.z) within the same major version maintain API and feature compatibility
* **Major versions** (**x**.y.z) may introduce breaking changes and require specific upgrade procedures

## Prerequisites

Before initiating any upgrade operation, verify the following conditions:

1. **Version Compatibility**: Current version must be within supported upgrade paths
2. **Component Health**: All Redis instances must report Ready status
3. **Resource Availability**: Cluster must have sufficient CPU, memory, and storage resources
4. **Backup**: Ensure recent backups of critical data and configuration

## Supported Upgrade Paths

The following upgrade matrix details tested version combinations and their dependencies:

| Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS Version | Redis Server Versions      | ACP Version | Kubernetes Versions       |
|:-------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|:------------|:--------------------------|
| v4.1.0                                     | 5.0.14, 6.0.20, 7.2.10     | v4.1.0      | 1.29, 1.30, 1.31, 1.32    |
| v4.0.x                                     | 5.0.14, 6.0.20, 7.2.x      | v4.0.x      | 1.28, 1.29, 1.30, 1.31    |

## Upgrade Strategies

### Minor Version Upgrade

* **Approach**: Any minor version can be upgraded to a newer minor version (e.g., 4.0.x → 4.2.x).
* **Benefits**: Minimizes risk and ensures smooth transition between versions

### Patch Version Upgrade

* **Compatibility**: Fully compatible within the same minor version series
* **Example**: Upgrade from `4.1.0` to `4.1.1` for bug fixes and security patches

### Major Version Upgrade

* **Requirement**: Must upgrade to the earliest available minor release of the target major version first
* **Procedure**: Follow specific major version upgrade documentation for detailed steps
* **Considerations**: May require configuration changes and feature compatibility review

## Upgrade Execution

Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS supports two upgrade execution modes:

* **Automatic**: System automatically detects and applies new versions when available
* **Manual**: Requires explicit administrator approval before initiating upgrade procedures

### Operational Considerations

* **Downtime**: Plan for minimal service interruption during upgrade operations
* **Rollback**: Ensure rollback procedures are understood and tested
* **Monitoring**: Closely monitor system metrics and logs during upgrade process
* **Validation**: Perform post-upgrade validation of all critical functionality
