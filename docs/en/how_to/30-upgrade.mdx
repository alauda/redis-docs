# Patch Version Upgrade

Redis patch version upgrades provide security fixes and stability improvements. The upgrade process utilizes a rolling update strategy, sequentially restarting pods to maintain service availability throughout the operation. Strategic scheduling of upgrades during maintenance windows is recommended to minimize potential impact on production workloads.

When patch versions become available, prompt adoption is advised to ensure your Redis instances benefit from the latest security patches and feature enhancements.
