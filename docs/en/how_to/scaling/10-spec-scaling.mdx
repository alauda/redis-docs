# Instance Specification Change

As data volume increases, it is crucial to expand the resources promptly before reaching the storage quota to ensure continuous availability of the service.

## Restrictions

1. If you have configured scheduling settings for the current instance, any changes in the replica count must comply with the current scheduling configuration.

2. In Sentinel mode, due to the synchronization relationship between master and slave, all storage capacities must be set to the same target capacity to ensure proper data synchronization.

3. In Cluster mode, the storage capacities of different shards can be expanded separately, but the replica nodes within a shard must always have the same capacity.

4. When changing CPU and memory resources, please evaluate based on business requirements and resource availability to avoid expansion failures due to insufficient or excessive resources, which may lead to the instance being unable to start normally.

    To change the instance specifications, you can control it through the field `spec.resources` (refer to the [API documentation](../../apis/kubernetes_apis/redis/redis) for details).

    ```bash
    # Set the instance specification to cpu:300m, memory: 300Mi
    $ kubectl -n default patch redis s6 --type=merge --patch='{"spec": {"resources":{"limits":{"cpu": "300m","memory":"300Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"300m", "memory":"300Mi"}}}}'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. Click on **Redis** in the left navigation bar.

    2. Click on ***namespace name***.

    3. Click on ***instance name***.

    4. In the **Details** tab, click on **Update Specifications** above the topology.

    5. Fill in the desired replica count and new specifications for the corresponding resources.

    6. Click **Update**.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After a moment, you will see the corresponding changes in the **Specifications** in the topology.
