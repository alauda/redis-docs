## v4.0.0

### New and Optimized Features

#### Component-Platform Decoupling

Alauda Cache Services for Redis OSS's lifecycle has been decoupled from platform's, which means when customer needs a certain feature or a bug fix, Redis team can release immediately instead of waiting for the platform release together.

#### Real-Time Logs on Component Details Page

The logs on Redis details page have been replaced with real-time logs that update instantly, facilitating troubleshooting and issue analysis.

#### External Access via LoadBalancer for Redis

LoadBalancer access is now supported for Redis. When creating an instance, users can choose to expose services externally through a LoadBalancer-type Service.

Compare to NodePort, LoadBalancer provides better high availability, performance, and export standard port. It is recommended to use the LoadBalancer method in production environments.

##### Limitations

When using LoadBalancer, ensure that the cluster has available external address pools. We recommend using MetalLB to create external address pools for the cluster.
