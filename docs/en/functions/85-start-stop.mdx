# Start and Stop Instance

The one-click start and stop feature meets the daily development and operation needs, allowing you to quickly pause or start middleware instances. In scenarios such as planned downtime, excessive node load, or development and testing environments, you may need to temporarily free up CPU and memory resources without deleting the instance. The one-click start and stop feature helps you save resources and flexibly manage middleware instances, thus reducing costs and improving efficiency.
