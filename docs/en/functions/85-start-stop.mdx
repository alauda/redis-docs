# Start and Stop Instance

Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS provides one-click start and stop functionality to support operational flexibility in managing middleware instances. This capability is particularly valuable for temporarily releasing resources without deleting instances during maintenance windows, high node load scenarios, or in development/testing environments. Efficiently managing instance state helps optimize resource utilization and reduce operational costs.

## Stop Instance

Stopping a Redis instance gracefully suspends its operation while preserving configuration and persistent data.

### Prerequisites

The instance must be in one of the following states: **Processing**, **Running**, **Abnormal**, or **Unknown**.

### Steps

  <Tab label="Web Console">
    > **Recommendation**: Perform a complete backup before stopping an instance to safeguard against potential data loss.

    1. In the left navigation bar, click **Redis**.

    2. Click on ***namespace name***.

    3. Click on ***instance name***.

    4. Click **Actions** > **Stop**, and confirm the operation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Features Unavailable During Stopped State

| Feature | Limitation |
| ------- | ---------- |
| **Terminal Console** | Terminal access to Redis instances is unavailable. |
| **Actions** | Instance operations including restart, update, and scheduling configuration changes are disabled. |
| **Topology** | Topology visualization is unavailable as the instance components are not running. |
| **Parameter Configuration** | Parameter updates and configuration exports cannot be performed. |
| **User Management** | User administration functionality is inaccessible. |
| **Backup & Restore** | New backup operations cannot be initiated. |
| **Inspection** | Inspection metrics and results for the stopped instance are invalid. |
| **Access Method** | Routing information may be unavailable or inaccessible. |

## Start Instance

Starting a previously stopped Redis instance restores full functionality and service availability.

### Prerequisites

The instance must be in **Stopping** or **Stopped** state.

### Steps

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. In the left navigation bar, click **Redis**.

    2. Click on ***namespace name***.

    3. Click on ***instance name***.

    4. Click **Actions** > **Start**, and confirm the operation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After the start operation completes successfully, the instance transitions to the **Running** state and all features become available again.
