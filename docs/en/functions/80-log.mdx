# Log Query

Understand the logs of instance operations from the container level, such as Redis error logs. Proper use of logs can help you quickly locate issues and handle faults and exceptions.

**Note**: To save disk space, the platform retains logs for a default period of 7 days (up to a maximum of 30 days). The actual retention duration can be configured in the operation and maintenance center under **Logs** > **Policy Management**. If long-term storage is required, please export the logs in a timely manner.

## Prerequisites

If the interface prompts that there is no data, please deploy the **Log Collection Component** and ensure that the component is running normally.
