# Access Methods

There are various connection methods for business applications to access Redis instances. This section describes how to select connection addresses and access Redis instances in sentinel mode or cluster mode through those addresses.

## How to Obtain Access Addresses

Redis instances support multiple access addresses to meet the demands of different scenarios. The access methods introduced here refer to standard Redis access methods. For more details, please refer to the community documentation:

- [Redis Cluster Mode Specification](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec/)
- [Redis Sentinel Mode Client Specification](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/sentinel-clients/)

### Internal Cluster Access Addresses

Internal cluster access is only available for accessing the Kubernetes network. There are two options for the connection address:

1. Internal routing (i.e., via DNS)
2. Internal routing IP

Both methods allow access to the Redis cluster mode or sentinel mode.

### External Cluster Access Addresses

External cluster access can be used for network access outside of Kubernetes, such as accessing from another Kubernetes cluster (it can also be used for internal access within the Kubernetes cluster, which requires confirming firewall rules to see if they allow this).

Currently, two types of external access methods are supported: NodePort and LoadBalancer.

<Directive type="warning" title="NodePort Access Instructions">
  To access NodePort from outside the Kubernetes cluster, you need to ensure that the firewall has allowed the corresponding IP and NodePort. Due to the architectural limitations of Redis Sentinel and Cluster, it is necessary to ensure network connectivity between the application and NodePort. It is not supported to forward the NodePort address of the instance through a Load Balancer (LB) as a proxy.

  In the case of multiple network cards, Redis Sentinel and Cluster will select the default network card IP of the node to initialize the access addresses of each Redis node. Therefore, access through the node's non-default IP + exposed port is not supported. In this situation, it is recommended to use the Load Balancer access method to create instances.

## Connection Access

Examples demonstrate how to access Redis instances using clients such as Jedis, Lettuce, Redisson, and go-redis. For more client connection examples, please refer to the community.

### Sentinel Mode

Each sentinel instance corresponds to the cluster name `mymaster`.

For examples of connecting to Redis instances, please refer to [Accessing Instances (Sentinel Mode)](../how_to/access/10-sentinel.mdx)

### Cluster Mode

Once a client connects to any node in the cluster, it will query the slot distribution of the cluster. During data access, the client needs to connect directly to each Pod. To ensure connection reliability, it is recommended that the client fill in the access addresses of all Pods.

For examples of connecting to Redis instances, please refer to [Accessing Instances (Cluster Mode)](../how_to/access/20-cluster.mdx)
