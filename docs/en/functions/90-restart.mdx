# Restarting an Instance

If you encounter faults during the instance operation, excessive connection counts, or other unspecified unknown issues that are difficult to diagnose, you can resolve the issues by restarting the instance.

## Precautions

During the restart process, Pods will be restarted one by one, which may cause a brief disruption in services.

## Preconditions

The instance must be in the **Running** state.

**Note**:

- If the instance is in the **Processing** state, it indicates that the instance may be starting normally; please be patient.

- If the instance fails to start or is abnormal, meaning the instance is in the **Processing** or **Error** state, it will automatically restart after the health check times out; please be patient.
