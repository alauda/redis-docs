# Backup and Restore

Implementing a robust backup strategy is essential for data protection. Regular backups provide recovery options in case of database anomalies or data corruption incidents.

Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS supports two backup methodologies:

* **S3 Backup:** Stores backup data in S3-compatible object storage systems, providing scalable and durable off-cluster backup capabilities.
* **PVC Backup:** Utilizes Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims to store backup data on persistent volumes. This method requires PV infrastructure that supports both node migration and the ReadWriteMany access mode, such as NFS or Ceph storage systems.

## Prerequisites

To utilize S3 backup functionality with your own storage buckets, confirm with your administrator that S3 storage integration has been properly configured for your project namespace. Alternatively, ensure your cluster provides a network-based `StorageClass` capable of provisioning appropriate storage resources.

## Immediate Backup

An immediate backup creates a point-in-time snapshot of your running Redis instance.

### Steps

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. In the left navigation panel, click **Redis**.

    2. Click on ***Namespace Name***.

    3. Click on ***Instance Name***.

    4. Navigate to the **Backup & Restore** tab and click **Create Backup**.

    5. Configure the backup parameters and click **Create**. The backup process duration varies based on data volume and network conditions. Monitor the process status in the backup list.

## Automatic Backup

Automatic backups allow you to schedule regular, recurring backups of your Redis instance according to your data protection requirements.

### Steps

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. In the left navigation panel, click **Redis**.

    2. Click on ***Namespace Name***.

    3. Click on ***Instance Name***.

    4. In the **Backup & Restore** tab, locate the **Automatic Backup Setting** section and click the edit button ![](../assets/44buttoneditblue.png).

    5. Enable **Automatic Backup** and configure the backup schedule and retention parameters.

    6. Click **Update** to apply the automatic backup configuration.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Restore

The restore operation creates a new Redis instance populated with data from a previous backup.

### Steps

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. In the left navigation panel, click **Redis**.

    2. Click on ***Namespace Name***.

    3. Navigate to the source instance's **Backup & Restore** tab, locate the desired backup, and click ![](../assets/44buttonanniu.png) > **Recover**.

    4. Configure the target instance parameters and click **Recover**. Monitor the recovery progress until the target instance reaches the **Running** state, indicating successful restoration.
