# Deleting an Instance

Deleting an instance will remove not only the created CR resources but also the StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims, and other resources created by RedisOperator based on the CR resources.

## Steps to Operate

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="CLI">
    If the instance does not have persistence enabled, or if you need to keep the persistent data of the instance, execute the following command to delete the instance:

    ```bash
    # delete redis instance directly
    kubectl -n default delete redis <Instance Name>
    ```

    If you want to delete the instance and also remove its persistent volume claim, you can execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    # patch finalizer `delete-pvc` to instance
    kubectl -n default patch redis <Instance Name> --type='merge' -p '{"metadata": {"finalizers": ["delete-pvc"]}}'

    # delete redis instance with pvc
    kubectl -n default delete redis <Instance Name>
    ```

    > `delete-pvc` is a built-in keyword in the Redis Operator, used to instruct the operator to delete the persistent volume storage when deleting the instance.

    3. From the instance list, select the instance you want to delete to enter the instance details page.

    4. In the upper right corner of the **Instance Details** page, click the **Operations** button to expand the menu options.

    5. Click on **Delete** in the menu, and a deletion confirmation box will pop up.

    6. For instances with data persistence enabled, you can check "Delete Persistent Volume Claim" to free up storage, or leave it unchecked to retain the data.
